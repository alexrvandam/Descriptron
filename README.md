# Descriptron
A Detectron2 model zoo of dark taxa morphology and computer vision to make it useful for taxonomists

#Version
v0.1.0

#Introduction
Detectron v0.1.0 is intended to automate geometric morphometrics of organismal morphological features. It combines the state-of-the-art CNN based instance segmentation of Detectron2 implemented in PyTorch with classic computer vision implemented in OpenCV. The instance segmentation is done using a CNN as that because that is what CNN's are best at and the precise pixel level data extraction is done using OpenCV as that is what classic computer vision is best at. I aim to use the correct tool for the job at hand. It is all written in python so it is more stable and all the programs play well together.

#Installation
