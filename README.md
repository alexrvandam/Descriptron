# Descriptron

A pipeline and code hub for dark taxa mophology using CNNs/ViTs, classic computer vision, that talks to VLMs (GPT-4o). 
It helps taxonomists automate taxonomic species descriptions. It can also be used to automate 2D measurements and
geometric morphometrics, and experimental 3D measurements. Additionally workflows allow for quantification of color#
and color pattern. It also quantifies taxonomic species descriptions using joint image and text embeddings.

# Introduction
Descriptron v0.1.0 is intended to automate geometric morphometrics of organismal morphological features. It combines the state-of-the-art CNN based instance segmentation of Detectron2 (https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) implemented in PyTorch with classic computer vision implemented in OpenCV. The instance segmentation is via a CNN because that is what CNN's are best at and the precise pixel level data extraction is done using OpenCV as that is what classic computer vision is best at. I aim to use the correct tool for the job at hand. It is all written in python so it is more stable and all the programs play well together.

This work here helps move towards solving automated semi-landmarking, morphometrics, color extraction, and semantic prediction using GPT4-V of 2D data using Psyllidae to automate taxonomic species descriptions. This should be helpful to people interested in ground-truthing measurements for species delimitation using morphological shape and size as data in that delimitation process. This is a first version future versions will continue to expand the capabilities of computer vision and deep-learning for making geometric and standard morphometric analyses more available and in a stable format for the community. We plan to add keypoints very soon and line models as well. We also plan to add stero-vision capabilities for more accurate 3d measurements. For now I implement a forward facing 3d measurements using depth from defocus and depth maps, it is experimental so all 3d measurements all need validation at this stage. The 2d measurements should be very accurate depending on how you set up your pictures, measure your scale bars or utilize a known distance to pixel ratio. 

The long term goal of this project is to combine LLM ViTs with instance segmentation and image depth data to produce fine grained descriptions and concomitant semi-supervised and unsupervised clustering for putative novel species binning and accurate automated taxomic descriptions, with taxonomists firmly placed at the helm over this new technology.

# Installation Recommended Way (Linux, Mac) Windows coming soon.

```bash
# (1) Downlad miniconda or conda if you don't already have it installed
https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/#

## Follow the instructions for your computer (linux, windows, and mac are available).

# (2) open terminal or cmd prompt
git clone https://github.com/alexrvandam/Descriptron.git

cd Descriptron

# (3) load the environments
## make sure you have python activated
which python
conda env list
## fire up the environments
conda init
## close and re-start your terminal or cmd prompt then do
## on bash kernal
source ~/.bashrc
## on zsh kernal
source ~/.zshrc
## next activate your base environment and make sure you knwo what it is, a good idea is to take notes here
conda activate base
which python
conda env list
## a '*' should be next to yoru base environment
## this will be the base conda or miniconda you will be adding the environments around
## then if you have not already

cd Descriptron

cd environments_to_ship

## next build the environments
conda env create -f samm_env.yml
conda env create -f detectron2_env_env.yml
conda env create -f measure_env_env.yml
conda env create -f metric3d_env.yml
conda env create -f gpt4_env.yml

### then activate each one at a time and install requirements
conda activate samm
pip install -r samm_requirements.txt
### probably there will be errors, most likely FAIR/META will have moved SAM2 and Detectron2, if that happens
### you can get them from the GoolgleDrive folder under Linux Heavy Duty or download them yourself from FAIR/META
conda deactivate
conda activate detectron2_env
pip install -r detectron2_env_requirements.txt
### again you may have to git install Detectron2 manually 
conda deactivate
cond activate measure_env
pip install -r measure_env_requirements.txt
##
conda deactivate
conda activate metric3d
pip install metric3d_env_requirements.txt
conda deactivate
conda activate gpt4
pip install gpt4_env_requirements.txt
conda deactivate
conda activate samm

#### ok now the samm environment should be activated
## now the early August version of sam2 was taken down in the middle of coding this project, so luckily you can download it from the link here

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cd4b2Sn-0nhSTU_JYzQXxFA8i91e_jnp?usp=sharing

## copy the segment-anything-2 folder to your desktop and one at at time copy the folders to this segment-anything-2 folder,
## you will also need to copy the Metric3d files and folders into the metric3d folder
## they should all be under one folder Descriptron/segment-anything-2/gui/metric3d/Metric3d/*
## once completed you should have 

Descriptron/segment-anything-2/gui
## or if you run this command from the gui folder 
# Descriptron/segment-anything-2/gui$
ls -1 -d */
# you should see
detectron2/
idefics/
measure/
metric3d/


## if that is correct then navigate the to gui folder or run the lauchv4.sh script if you know how to change your conda path and
## then simply right click and run as script if you have changed your conda path correctly as well as the script path
## OR if you have made it this far it might just be better to

cd  Descriptron/segment-anything-2/gui
### or what ever relative file path gets you into the gui folder you need to run the script from there
### then simply

conda run -n samm python descriptron-label-206.py

### that should do it the GUI should run
```

# Linux Heavy Duty Way
If you are on a linux machine and you have conda-pack (conda install -c conda-forge conda-pack) you can unpack my environments with all the downloads in place, you will then have to modify the 
launch_guiv4.sh script to match your conda path. It is about 80GB unpacked

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cd4b2Sn-0nhSTU_JYzQXxFA8i91e_jnp?usp=sharing


# The Linux Last Resort Hard Way
copy my folder, it is my project folder that is frozen with everyting in it you will need to have a file path that has /home/localuser/ in #
order to get it to run otherwise it will not unpack do to symbolic links it is about 140GB

Here we test for the first time a current state-of-the-art Vision Language Model (VLM) to approximate taxonomic species descriptions in an automated manner. The test utilizes a new graphical user interface, Descriptron, that collects data about biological images and transmits this highly specialized knowledge to a VLM to decode the taxonomic knowledge encoded in labeled biological images with text. Our results indicate that current state-of-the-art VLM (GPT-4o) can produce automated species descriptions that with error correction approximate taxonomists ability to describe morphological features of species and organize them in taxonomic keys. However, the results are not without significant errors and the VLM requires the input of the taxonomists knowledge to prevent widespread hallucinations by the VLM. We find here that the taxonomist is clearly needed to both teach and closely supervise the VLM. However, the time saved by utilizing Descriptron is also significant. Taxonomists remain essential for teaching and closely supervising the VLM. The time saved by utilizing Descriptron are nevertheless already very significant.
