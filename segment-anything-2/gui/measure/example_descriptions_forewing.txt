Forewing with bright yellow to dark brown veins and colourless to greyish membrane with indistinct yellow to distinct brownish patch along vein Cu1b, fumose in the middle of all cells and almost transparent along the veins. Forewing oblong-oval, broadly, evenly rounded apically; vein C+Sc weakly curved, pterostigma long, vein Rs straight apically; vein M about as long as either of veins M1+2 and M3+4; surface spinules present in all cells, leaving broad spinule-free stripes along the veins, sparsely and irregularly spaced, sometimes spinules entirely reduced in apical half of the wing; radular spinules covering triangular areas along the margin of cells r2, m1, m2 and cu1.Entire forewing 1mm in length 0.5mm in width roughly twice as long as it is wide.
Forewing with pale to bright yellow veins and pale yellow to amber-coloured membrane. Forewing oval, narrowly, evenly rounded apically; vein C+Sc weakly curved, pterostigma long, vein Rs straight, curved backwards apically; vein M about as long as either of veins M1+2 and M3+4; surface spinules present in all cells, leaving narrow spinule-free stripes along the veins, relatively densely and irregularly spaced; absent at base of cell c+sc; radular spinules covering triangular areas along the margin of cells r2, m1, m2 and cu1.Entire forewing 1mm in length 0.5mm in width roughly twice as long as it is wide.
Forewing with pale yellow veins and colourless membrane with indistinct brown patch along vein Cu1b and yellowish shadows in apical part of cells r1, r2, m1, m2 and cu1.Â Forewing oval, broadly, evenly rounded apically; vein C+Sc hardly curved, pterostigma long, vein Rs weakly sinuous, almost straight apically; vein M about as long as either of veins M1+2 and M3+4; surface spinules absent; radular spinules covering triangular areas along the margin of cells r2, m1, m2 and cu1. Entire forewing 1mm in length 0.5mm in width roughly twice as long as it is wide.
