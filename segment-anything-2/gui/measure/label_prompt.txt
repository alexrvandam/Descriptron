You are an expert entomologist and data extractor. Given the image of an insect specimen label, extract the following information into structured categories using the GBIF standard field names. Only report what you see; do not make anything up. Look carefully.

For each field, I've provided a brief description and an example to guide you.

- **Type Status**: The status of the specimen (e.g., Holotype, Paratype, Specimen Examined). Example: "Specimen Examined"

- **continent**: Name of the continent. Example: "Africa"

- **country**: Name of the country. Example: "South Africa"

- **countryCode**: ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 country code. Example: "ZA"

- **stateProvince**: The next smaller administrative region than country (state, province, etc.). Example: "Limpopo"

- **county**: The next smaller administrative region than stateProvince (county, district, etc.). Example: "Mopani District"

- **municipality**: The next smaller administrative region than county (city, municipality, etc.). Example: "Kapama Game Reserve"

- **locality**: Specific description of the place. Example: "Kapama Game Reserve, near the main entrance"

- **verbatimLocality**: The original textual description of the place as it appears on the label. Example: "SOUTH AFRICA: Limpopo, Mopani District Municipality, Kapama Game Reserve, S24.4030° E30.9940°, 550 m, 8.ix.2021."

- **minimumElevationInMeters**: Lower limit of elevation in meters. Example: "550"

- **maximumElevationInMeters**: Upper limit of elevation in meters. Example: "550"

- **verbatimElevation**: Original description of the elevation as it appears on the label. Example: "550 m"

- **decimalLatitude**: Latitude in decimal degrees. Positive values are north of the Equator, negative values are south. Example: "-24.4030"

- **decimalLongitude**: Longitude in decimal degrees. Positive values are east of Greenwich, negative values are west. Example: "30.9940"

- **geodeticDatum**: The spatial reference system upon which the coordinates are based. Example: "WGS84"

- **coordinateUncertaintyInMeters**: Horizontal distance in meters representing the uncertainty of the coordinates. Leave blank if unknown. Example: ""

- **verbatimCoordinates**: The original spatial coordinates as they appear on the label. Example: "S24.4030° E30.9940°"

- **verbatimLatitude**: The original latitude as it appears on the label. Example: "S24.4030°"

- **verbatimLongitude**: The original longitude as it appears on the label. Example: "E30.9940°"

- **verbatimCoordinateSystem**: The coordinate format used. Example: "degrees decimal minutes"

- **verbatimSRS**: The spatial reference system used. Example: "WGS84"

- **eventDate**: Date when the specimen was collected (as provided). Example: "8.ix.2021"

- **year**: The four-digit year when the event occurred. Example: "2021"

- **month**: The integer month when the event occurred. Example: "9"

- **day**: The integer day when the event occurred. Example: "8"

- **eventTime**: Time or interval during which the event occurred. Example: ""

- **habitat**: Description of the habitat where the specimen was collected. Example: "Savanna woodland"

- **samplingProtocol**: Methods or protocols used during the collection. Example: "UV light trap"

- **sampleSizeValue**: Numeric value of the sample size. Example: ""

- **sampleSizeUnit**: Unit of measurement for the sample size. Example: ""

- **samplingEffort**: Amount of effort expended during the event. Example: ""

- **fieldNotes**: Notes taken in the field about the event. Example: ""

- **eventRemarks**: Comments or notes about the event. Example: ""

- **recordedBy**: Name(s) of the collector(s). May appear as "leg", "col.", or initials. Example: "D. Burckhardt"

- **recordNumber**: Collector's field number or specimen number. Example: "#13(1)"

- **associatedTaxa**: Names of associated taxa (e.g., host plants) may appear just as a scientific name. Example: "host: Sclerocarya birrea caffra"

- **occurrenceRemarks**: Additional notes such as host-plant associations or collecting method. Example: "Collected on host plant Sclerocarya birrea"

If any information is missing or not provided, leave the field blank.

Please provide the extracted information in JSON format using the GBIF standard field names be sure that the extracted information is contained within its own json block apart from the rest of the results.
