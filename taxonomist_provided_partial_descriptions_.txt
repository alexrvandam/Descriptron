Russelliana solanicola 	solanicola	description		Forewing with pale to dark brown veins, becoming darker towards apex, and colourless to greyish membrane with indistinct brown patches along the veins Cu and Cu1b, at apices of veins R1, Rs, M1+2, M3+4, Cu1a and often between bifurcation of vein M and apical part of cell r1. Forewing oblong-oval, narrowly rounded apically; vein C+Sc weakly curved, pterostigma long, vein Rs almost straight apically; vein M about as long as either of veins M1+2 and M3+4; surface spinules very dense, present in all cells, leaving no spinule-free stripes along the veins, irregularly spaced; radular spinules covering triangular areas along the margin of cells r2, m1, m2 and cu1.	solanicola.jpg
Russelliana tetraglochin 	tetraglochin	description		Forewing membrane with pale yellow to brownish veins and yellow to brownish membrane, both becoming slightly darker towards apical part. Forewing oblong-oval, narrowly rounded apically; vein C+Sc weakly curved, pterostigma long, vein Rs almost straight apically; vein M about as long as either of veins M1+2 and M3+4; surface spinules absent; radular spinules covering triangular areas along the margin of cells r2, m1, m2 and cu1.	tetraglochin.jpg
Russelliana theresae 	theresae	description		Forewing with whitish to dark brown veins and semitransparent, colourless membrane with dark brown pattern, similar to R. marionae, consisting of two broad stripes: submarginal one stretching from apical part of costal vein to median part of vein Cu1a, along vein Cu1a and to base of vein M1+2, sometimes leaving light areas in cells m1 and m2 along the margin, and median one stretching from base of pterostigma, along the veins R, M+Cu and Cu, to base of vein Cu1b; membrane between stripes colourless, with dots varying in size and number. Forewing oblong-oval, broadly, evenly rounded apically; vein C+Sc weakly curved, pterostigma long, vein Rs weakly sinuous, curved to fore margin apically; vein M slightly longer than either of veins M1+2 and M3+4; surface spinules very dense, present in all cells, leaving no spinule-free stripes along the veins, irregularly spaced, less developed on unpigmented areas; radular spinules not pronounced.	theresae.jpg
Russelliana vinculipennis 	vinculipennis	description		Forewing with brown veins and colourless membrane consisting of dark brown pattern of patch along vein Cu1b and scattered dots covering most of the membrane, sometimes forming distinct transverse band stretching from apical part of costal vein to apex of vein Cu1a, leaving light areas in cells r2, m1 and m2 along the margin. Forewing oblong-oval, broadly, unevenly rounded apically; vein C+Sc weakly curved, pterostigma long, vein Rs almost straight apically; vein M about as long as either of veins M1+2 and M3+4; surface spinules present in all cells, leaving no spinule-free stripes along the veins, densely and irregularly spaced, less developed on unpigmented areas; absent in cell c+sc except for a group of spinules in the middle, sometimes covering entire cell; radular spinules covering rounded areas along the margin of cells r2, m1, m2 and cu1.	vinculipennis.jpg
Russelliana viscosae 	viscosae	description		Forewing with yellow veins and semitransparent, evenly yellow membrane. Forewing oviform; vein C+Sc strongly curved in the middle, pterostigma long, vein Rs straight apically; vein M slightly longer than either of veins M1+2 and M3+4; surface spinules absent; densely and irregularly spaced in cell c+sc except for base and apex; radular spinules covering rounded areas along the margin of cells r2, m1, m2 and cu1.	/home/localuser/psilidae/Russelliana_forewing_croped_JPEG/viscosae.jpg
Russelliana xantha 	xantha	description		Forewing with yellow veins and with semitransparent, amber-coloured membrane. Forewing oblong-oval, broadly, unevenly rounded apically; vein C+Sc weakly curved, pterostigma long, vein Rs straight or weakly sinuous, almost straight apically; vein M about as long as either of veins M1+2 and M3+4; surface spinules faint, present in all cells, leaving narrow to broad spinule-free stripes along the veins, sparsely spaced, forming indistinct hexagons in apical half, sometimes spinules entirely reduced in apical half of the wing; absent at least at base of cell c+sc; radular spinules covering triangular areas along the margin of cells r2, m1, m2 and cu1.	/home/localuser/psilidae/Russelliana_forewing_croped_JPEG/xantha.jpg
