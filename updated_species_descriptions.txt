Description:

The forewing of *nana* is broad with a short width-to-length ratio and an oblong oval shape. It features pale brown veins and a completely hyaline membrane, moderately covered with spinules forming a pattern of two hexagonal rows. The veins are pale yellow, with no color pigmentation present along the apices of the pterostigma and veins Rs, M1+2, M3+4, Cu1a, and Cu1b. Spinule-free strips are narrow and present along all veins. The apical two-thirds of vein C+Sc is nearly straight, and there is no costal break between vein C+Sc and the pterostigma. The pterostigma cell is absent. Vein Rs is relatively straight and slightly turns up to the wing margin apically. Cell M1 is broad and short, while cell Cu1 is broad and long. Vein Cu1a is strongly convex along its entire length, with its apex moderately arced towards the posterior margin. The forewing is widest in the middle, with a broadly and evenly rounded apical margin, and is without setae.
